## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract color palettes from images captured via a webcam using Node.js, GridDB, and OpenAI. By leveraging Node.js for server-side scripting, GridDB for efficient data storage, and OpenAI for advanced image processing, we will create a seamless pipeline to capture images, analyze them, and generate dynamic color palettes. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, capturing images from your webcam, and using AI to extract and store color data effectively.
