## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract color palettes from images captured via a webcam using Node.js, GridDB, and OpenAI. By leveraging Node.js for server-side scripting, GridDB for efficient data storage, and OpenAI for advanced image processing, we will create a seamless pipeline to capture images, analyze them, and generate dynamic color palettes. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, capturing images from your webcam, and using AI to extract and store color data effectively.

## Running The Project



## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- GridDB
- OpenAI API access
- A webcam

## Setting Up the Environment

### 1. Installing Node.js

This project will run on the Node.js platform. You need to install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). For this project, we will use the `nvm` package manager and Node.js v16.20.2
LTS version.

```shell
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# download and install Node.js
nvm install 16

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v16.20.2`

# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `8.19.4``
```

To connect Node.js and GridDB database, you need the [gridb-node-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) npm package which is a Node.js binding developed using GridDB C Client and Node addon API.

### 2. Setting Up GridDB

We will use the GridDB database to save recipes and it's nutrition analysis. Please look at the [guide](https://docs.griddb.net/latest/gettingstarted/using-apt/#install-with-apt-get) for detailed installation. We will use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS here.

Run GridDB and check if the service is running. Use this command:

```shell
sudo systemctl status gridstore
```

If not running try to run the database with this command:

```shell
sudo systemctl start gridstore
```
